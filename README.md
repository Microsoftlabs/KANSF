Online Marketing Software is software used to ease the daily life of consumers by decreasing the gap between consumer and buyer and increasing convenience.
KANS here implies to as KINDLE AND NEO SHOPPING. The software's main motive is to provide a simple and interactive GUI to the user especially buyers. For this Tkinter and PIL libraries are used. The software support Profile Management,Item Management for all types of user viz. Seller, Buyers.
The project has been set on a dark theme to make it look appealing to the user. This project has ample use of Frames to avoid annoying pop-up window for each page change. This project also displays Images to provide a user-friendly environment. The software uses MySQL to store data which provide the user with smooth and limitless working.
The code is required to be configured very less to run, so it provides extreme portability and minimal setup.
The source code was initially written and run in Spyder (Python 3.6). But it has been run on IDLE (Python 3.9) also.
The code was been run and debugged multiple times to make sure that it is free of all error, but it can't be claimed to be error-free.
